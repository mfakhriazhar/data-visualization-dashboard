# Seattle Airbnb Dashboard Project using Tableau  
This repository contains a data visualization project that explores Airbnb listings in **Seattle** using **Tableau**. The dashboard provides insights into pricing, distribution, and revenue trends throughout the year.

## Project Overview  
This project explores Airbnb listings data from Seattle to uncover patterns in pricing, availability, and guest reviews. By cleaning and analyzing the dataset, the goal is to understand how various factors—such as room type, location, and number of reviews—impact listing performance. An interactive dashboard was developed using Power BI to present these insights in an accessible and actionable format.

## Project Goals
- Explore pricing patterns across neighborhoods and room types
- Identify trends in listing distribution and revenue over time
- Build an interactive and insightful dashboard using Tableau

## Key Insights  
- Private rooms tend to have significantly lower prices than entire homes, but also higher availability
- Downtown and Capitol Hill are among the most expensive and high-traffic areas
- Listings with more reviews tend to have slightly lower prices, indicating a possible trade-off between affordability and popularity
- A large portion of listings are available for less than 100 days per year, suggesting seasonal or part-time hosting patterns
- Superhost status and review scores show limited correlation to price but may affect trust and booking rates

## Dashboard Highlights  
- Average Price per Number of Bedrooms  
- Listings Count by Bedroom Count
- Price Distribution per Zipcode  
- Zipcode-Based Choropleth Map  
- Yearly Revenue Trend Analysis

## Conclusion  
The Seattle Airbnb market shows clear pricing patterns based on room type, location, and availability. Most listings are not full-time rentals, and pricing does not always correlate with quality metrics like reviews or superhost status. These insights can help hosts set more competitive prices and assist users in understanding the dynamics of Airbnb's local market. The Power BI dashboard provides an interactive way to explore these patterns and make data-driven decisions.

## Notes :
